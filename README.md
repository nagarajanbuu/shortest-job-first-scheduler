# shortest-job-first-scheduler
This project implements the Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling Algorithm using a web interface. The SJF algorithm is a scheduling policy that selects the process with the smallest execution time to execute next.
## Features
- Input the number of processes.
- Specify arrival and burst times for each process.
- Generate the scheduling order based on the SJF algorithm.
